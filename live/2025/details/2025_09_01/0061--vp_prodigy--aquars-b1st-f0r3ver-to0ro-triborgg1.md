### Roster Details<br />
Team Name: VP.Prodigy<br />
Roster: AquaRS, b1st, F0R3VER, tO0RO, TriBorgg1<br />
Global Rank: [61](../../standings_global_2025_09_01.md)<br />
<br />
Region: [Europe]( ../../standings_europe_2025_09_01.md)<br />
Regional Rank: [42]( ../../standings_europe_2025_09_01.md)<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value:  989.4<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value (989.4) = Starting Rank Value (897.5) + Head To Head Adjustments (92.0)<br />

#### Starting Rank Value<br />
To figure out a rosters's Starting Rank Value, first take the average of these four factors:<br />
- Bounty Offered: 0.412[<sup>1</sup>](#table2)
- Bounty Collected: 0.337[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- Opponent Network: 0.059[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- LAN Wins: 0.229[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)

The average of these factors is 0.259<br />
<br />
Next, take the maximum and minimum average across all teams and compute the following:<br />
- 400 + ( ( Roster_Average - Min_Average ) / ( Max_Average - Min_Average ) ) * 1600 = 897.5
- 400 + ( ( 0.259 - 0.000 ) / ( 0.834 - 0.000 ) ) * 1600 = 897.5


#### Factors<br />
Below you can see a table of all of the matches that contributed to this roster's Final Rank Value.<br />
Note:<br />

- For Bounty Collected, Opponent Network, and LAN Wins, we consider only the ten best results over the past 6 months.
- Raw values for those factors are multiplied by Age Weight. Bounty and Opponent Network values are also multiplied by Event Weight. The adjusted value is shown in parenthesis.
- The final value for a factor is the total of its adjusted values divided by 10. Bounty Collected is further scaled by the curve function[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)
- Head to head adjustments are based on rosters' starting rank values. The results shown below are adjusted by Age Weight and not Event Weight

To calculate a roster's Bounty Offered:<br />

- First, take the sum of their top 10 scaled winnings ($15,671.00)
- Divide that value by the 5th highest value among all rosters ($421,876.14)
- The final value (0.04) is scaled by the curve function.[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)

Top ten winnings for this roster:<br />

| Event Date | Age Weight | Prize Winnings | Scaled Winnings |
| :- | -: | :- | :- |
| 2025-08-23 |      1.000 | $13,921.00     | $13,921.00      |
| 2025-08-17 |      1.000 | $1,750.00      | $1,750.00       |
